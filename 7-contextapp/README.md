# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## contextapp project

### This project was built for practicing on Hooks and Context its idea is toggling the page theme

- Hooks let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let us use React without classes.

- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
-  In this project, I have explained how to use context inside function component and class component and how to use 'usecontext'.


### `To start a project :-` 

1- Run 'npm install react-scripts'
