# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## meetup project

###This is a meetup app where users can add meetup points, delete them and add meetups to favorites 


### This project was built using :-

### 1) React & Redux (frontend)

- React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. 
- React router V6 which is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React.
- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- Hooks let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let us use React without classes. 

### 2) Firebase (backend)

- I have used firebase (realtime database)


### `To start a project :-`
