- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- Reducers is code which centralizes our methodes for changing states into single function
- Local storage to store data locally in the user browser
- Hooks let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let us use React without classes.
