### `state management for building project`

- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- Reducers is code which centralizes methodes for changing states into single function.
- Local storage to store data locally in the user browser.
- Hooks let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let us use React without classes.
