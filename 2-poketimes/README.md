# Getting Started with Create React App

## poketimes project

This project was built to use and practices on React, Redux and other libraries.

- React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. 
- Redux facilitate state management as it is a central data store for all app data and any component can access data from it.
- React router V6 which is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React.
- Higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. 
- Hooks let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let us use React without classes. 
- Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase. On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
