### This project was built using :-

### 1) React & Redux (frontend)

- React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. 
- Redux facilitate state management as it is a central data store for all app data and any component can access data from it.
- Thunk to use Async code and return functions in actions.
- React router V6 which is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React.
- Higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. 
- Hooks let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let us use React without classes. 
- moment which is a date format library

### 2) Firebase (backend)

- I have used firestore and connect it with redux store to handle my data using 'react redux firebase' library.
- I have used firebase Authentication to handle user signin,signup and signout.
- I have used firebase hostig service.
